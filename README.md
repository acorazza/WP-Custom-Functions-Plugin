# WP Custom Functions Plugin

A simple plugin to add custom functions to WordPress.

This example includes my Google Analytics tracking code.

## Why?

It's better to use a plugin rather than a theme's `functions.php`. Theme files get overwritten with new versions when installing updates.

## What about Child Themes?

A custom plugin is simpler than using a child theme if you don't need custom CSS.
