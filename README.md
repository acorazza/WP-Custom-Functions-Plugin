# WP Custom Functions Plugin

A simple plugin to add custom functions to WordPress.

This example includes my Google Analytics tracking code.

## But why?

It's better to use a plugin rather than a theme's `functions.php`. Theme files get updated with new versions, and this is simpler than using a child theme if you don't need custom CSS.
