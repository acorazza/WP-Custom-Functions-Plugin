A simple plugin to add custom functions to WordPress. This example includes a Google Analytics tracking tag.

## Why would I use this?

It's better to use a plugin rather than a theme's `functions.php`. Theme files get overwritten with new versions when installing updates.

## Why not use a Child Theme?

A custom plugin is simpler than using a child theme if you don't need custom CSS â€” plus, you can use this plugin with any installed theme.
